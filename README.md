# Weekly Reports

## Week One 24-28 September

This was our first official week back and as such it was quite chilled back with introductions to each module and a few game meetings. The game group made huge progress with our ideas using mind maps and other fast prototyping methods. We are confident we want to use voxel based graphics as this solves many problems for us most notably a lack of artists. We were introduced to the 6502 Architecture which we will be using to create games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. I also found 10 sources for my dissertation but I haven't completely nailed my question yet.

## Week Two 1-5 October

I started working on the NES wiki as thats in very soon, managed to grab a topic that I feel comfortable talking about to be my main source of contributions but I will be adding to other pages too. I'm honestly struggling to understand the NES assembly language Ed is showing us. What I'm doing works but I look at it and it just looks like a foreign language to me. As a class we paired up and looked at each others dissertation proposals and then had to explain our partners to the class, this made me feel a bit more confident in my topic as well as seeing how other people approach different topics.  I've also started looking at some basic javascript games, I have found js very interesting and quite simple to use.

## Week Three 8-12 October

This week we presented our Demake ideas, I chose to demake Red Dead Redemption. This will consist of a basic shooting player with a few enemies, with the twist being that the player can walk up to a horse and get on it, shouldn't be too hard. I have spoke to Mike this week and think I have somewhat changed my topic to be more based on how the environment affects our decisions which I find quite interesting. We are still prototyping the game idea we had in the first week, its coming along very nicely and we already have a game loop and people keep coming and finding it cool.

## Week Four 15-19 October

This week we had to have our ethics form to show Mike, I had mine ready but unfortunatley had to miss the meeting due to illness. I have done a few of the live coding videos and am still struggling a lot, the thing works but I don't think I understand it at all. Might have to scope my game down a bit more. I had a random idea pop into my head when I was going to sleep so I got up the next morning and managed to make the game in around 2 hours, it's a very simple game but I think incredible unique in the way it uses the browsers scaling feature. It's incredible to see my ideas become a reality.
