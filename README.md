# Weekly Reports

## Week One 24-28 September

This was our first official week back and as such it was quite chilled back with introductions to each module and a few game meetings. The game group made huge progress with our ideas using mind maps and other fast prototyping methods. We are confident we want to use voxel based graphics as this solves many problems for us most notably a lack of artists. We were introduced to the 6502 Architecture which we will be using to create games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. I also found 10 sources for my dissertation but I haven't completely nailed my question yet.

## Week Two 1-5 October

I started working on the NES wiki as thats in very soon, managed to grab a topic that I feel comfortable talking about to be my main source of contributions but I will be adding to other pages too. I'm honestly struggling to understand the NES assembly language Ed is showing us. What I'm doing works but I look at it and it just looks like a foreign language to me. As a class we paired up and looked at each others dissertation proposals and then had to explain our partners to the class, this made me feel a bit more confident in my topic as well as seeing how other people approach different topics.  I've also started looking at some basic javascript games, I have found js very interesting and quite simple to use.

## Week Three 8-12 October

This week we presented our Demake ideas, I chose to demake Red Dead Redemption. This will consist of a basic shooting player with a few enemies, with the twist being that the player can walk up to a horse and get on it, shouldn't be too hard. I have spoke to Mike this week and think I have somewhat changed my topic to be more based on how the environment affects our decisions which I find quite interesting. We are still prototyping the game idea we had in the first week, its coming along very nicely and we already have a game loop and people keep coming and finding it cool.

## Week Four 15-19 October

This week we had to have our ethics form to show Mike, I had mine ready but unfortunatley had to miss the meeting due to illness. I have done a few of the live coding videos and am still struggling a lot, the thing works but I don't think I understand it at all. Might have to scope my game down a bit more. I had a random idea pop into my head when I was going to sleep so I got up the next morning and managed to make the game in around 2 hours, it's a very simple game but I think incredible unique in the way it uses the browsers scaling feature. It's incredible to see my ideas become a reality. 

## Week Five 22-26 October

This week we had our peer review for comp330 javascript applications which provided a lot of useful feedback. I do wish I was a little further along with this project but I am genuinley struggling with the NES work which is eating up a lot of my time. This peer review is a week earlier than previous ones so hopefully i will be able to get my work to a much better level. I also managed to setup my server this week and get my site hosted there properly. I need to start researching for my dissertation work as we were recommended to go for 60 sources and I would like to meet this. Mike discussed a lot of ethics stuff this week which was interesting too. Just need to keep an eye on the time I'm using for each projcet and be more aware.

## Week Six 29-2 October/November

This week was reading week so there was not much to talk about, I spent most of it reading and working on my NES game, however I would have liked to have got more done. I reached 3k words on my dissertation at this point which is ok but I think I need to plan out which module I'm going to work on each day so I dont just do a tonne of one thing and leave others out.

## Week Seven 5-9 November

This week we had the daunting task of presenting our dissertation findings which wasn't as bad as I had expected honestly but it was the longest we have had to do. I think it went quite well as I had done a lot of research but I'd also gone ahead and done a lot on my methodology too so I had a lot to talk about, the feedback was incredibley useful too. We were supposed to start working on our own NES games this week but I am still dumfounded by it, I'm going to have to finish and rewatch the NES live coding videos and hope they help.

## Week Eight 12-16 November

Following the submission of our javascript games last week we had a peer review for our dissertation this week which meant other modules were put on a backburner as I wanted to have something good to show off and get feedback on. People didn't seem to like that I had Lord on my essay which was funny. Time managment and prioritising is yet again proving to be an issue for me hopefully this will improve as our modules are handed in. Our team game is looking incredible at this point, we have come so far so fast and our game is definitley one of the better ones that I have seen, I need to look into post processing effects so it looks a bit better.

## Week Nine 19-23 November

This is the last week before NES handin so I have been trying to thrash that out, honestly I'll be surprised if I pass this, clearly its just not my thing. Somehow I have eneded up coding scripts for Oldschool runescape which is way more enjoyable. I cleaned up the code in our team game a lot this week as its quite messy which bugs me.

## Week Ten 26-30 November

This week was the deadlines for both comp320 proposal and comp310 NES game, thats why I spent most of last week working on the NES as that deadline was first on the monday. So this week I spent finalising my research review and I ended up submitting with the 60 sources as planned thanks to two last minute additions with Mike. I am happy to finally get these two out of the way as they were my biggest worries. Now I need to start working on the component which I have a lot of ideas for.

## Week Eleven 3-7 December

This week our team met up early most days to try get in as much as we could before deadline next week. I managed to get a nice looking post processing effect in game which was similar to borerlands, it basically drew black lines around objects in game and they would get lighter or darker depening on the intensity of the edge. It looks very cool in game. I also managed to fix the light issues we were having in game and made it look better overall.

## Week Twelve 10-14 December

I had to leave before this week because I couldnt get a lift home at any other point however I did some final touches to the team game before we handed it in. I think I could have contributed to that a lot more than I did but work this semester was really overwhelming me. I'm happy to finally have a break even if a small one because I need to get to work on my component asap.

## Summary 

This semester has been incredibly intense for me and sometimes I was worried I wouldn't be able to complete the course, however I have managed to meet all of my deadlines so I am both content and hopeful for next semester. Honestly I'm not sure I would like to do games programming when I finish, while I do enjoy programming a lot of the modules of the course I have either not been good out or flat out didn't like. However I can recognise that a lot of these niche modules I wouldn't face out in the real world I just have to find a job doing what I like, as I have done really well with the team games generally.  In the runup to graduation I need to work on my portfolio making it the best I possibley can and maybe look into what jobs are available and apply for some. I have rediscovered a bundle of udemy games course I had bought a year ago and plan on doing some of these, such as the unity course as I have zero experience here and would like to learn it. I'm also having a lot of fun scripting for runescape using Java so I will probably look more into that language, I used it on my college course and I enjoyed it.
