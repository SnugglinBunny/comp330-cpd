# Weekly Reports

## Week One 24-28 September

This was our first official week back and as such it was quite chilled back with introductions to each module and a few game meetings. The game group made huge progress with our ideas using mind maps and other fast prototyping methods. We are confident we want to use voxel based graphics as this solves many problems for us most notably a lack of artists.

## Week Two 1-5 October

## Week Three 8-12 October
